Smart Cities and Internet of Things
The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, 
vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart
devices"), buildings, and other items-embedded with electronics, software, 
sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects 
to collect and exchange data. IoT allows objects to be controlled
and gather information remotely across the already established network.
Details the partitioning of the system into layers(Application, Service,
Data Management and Communications), thus enabling robust system
design and development. The goal of this project is to implement a smart
vaccination center and vaccine storage facility with the help of IoT in
order to monitor specific criteria, control specific devices and provide
data analysis to the user in order to make an informed decision. Data
to be monitored are: People Traffic count, Temperature, inventory levels 
of particular vaccine and number of people who got vaccinated. Any
changes in the tracked data will be updated to the user if it changes
beyond a given threshold levels. Thus, aiming to provide an intelligent
solution for the required facility.

The current pandemic has exposed various shortcomings in the vaccination drive. The types of areas that necessitate urgent
treatment are the vaccine storage and management and vaccination drive. Most of the time, managing a huge crowd arriving at the vaccination center is a tedious task to handle manually, resulting in non-adherence of social distancing norms which aids in spreading the virus. Similarly, monitoring of vaccine stock is
laborious and involves human resources to keep track of inventory levels. So we have devised an Intelligent Vaccination Center and Storage Facility to address
the shortcomings mentioned above. Therefore we have come up with the concept to develop a smart Vaccine storage and inoculation facility to aid in storing, managing vaccines, and maintaining people congestion during vaccination drives inside a closed environment. The developed system is intended to minimize human-human interactions, energy consumption, and data analysis to equip the user with up-to-date information.
